= Attaching the Useful Sensors person sensor via I2C

This example code shows how to interface the Raspberry Pi Pico to the person sensor board. 

== Wiring information

Wiring up the device requires 4 jumpers, to connect VDD, GND, SDA and SCL. The example here uses I2C port 0, which is assigned to GPIO 4 (SDA) and 5 (SCL) in software. Power is supplied from the VSYS pin.

Follow the same wiring scheme as the MCP9808 shown below:
